module Paperclip
  # Paperclip processors allow you to modify attached files when they are
  # attached in any way you are able. Paperclip itself uses command-line
  # programs for its included Thumbnail processor, but custom processors
  # are not required to follow suit.
  #
  # Processors are required to be defined inside the Paperclip module and
  # are also required to be a subclass of Paperclip::Processor. There is
  # only one method you *must* implement to properly be a subclass:
  # #make, but #initialize may also be of use. #initialize accepts 3
  # arguments: the file that will be operated on (which is an instance of
  # File), a hash of options that were defined in has_attached_file's
  # style hash, and the Paperclip::Attachment itself. These are set as
  # instance variables that can be used within `#make`.
  #
  # #make must return an instance of File (Tempfile is acceptable) which
  # contains the results of the processing.
  #
  # See Paperclip.run for more information about using command-line
  # utilities from within Processors.
