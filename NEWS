* Improvement: Paperclip now supports aws-sdk v2
  @betesh, @davetchen,
  https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip/pull/1903

  If your Gemfile contains aws-sdk (>= 2.0.0) and aws-sdk-v1, paperclip will use
  aws-sdk v2. With aws-sdk v2, S3 storage requires you to set the s3_region.
  s3_region may be nested in s3_credentials, and (if not nested in
  s3_credentials) it may be a Proc.

4.3.1 (2015-09-09):

3.1.1:

* Bug Fix: Paperclip will only load Paperclip::Schema only when Active Record is available.

3.1.0:

          create_table :users do |t|
            t.attachment :avatar

  `Paperclip::Railtie` was intended to be used with Ruby on Rails only. If you're
  using Paperclip without Rails, you should include `Paperclip::Glue` into
  `ActiveRecord::Base` instead of requiring `paperclip/railtie`:

      ActiveRecord::Base.send :include, Paperclip::Glue

* Bug Fix: AttachmentContentTypeValidator now allow you to specify :allow_blank/:allow_nil

  filesystem conflicts and scales to handle larger numbers of uploads.

  The easiest way to upgrade is to add an explicit :url and :path to your
  has_attached_file calls:

      has_attached_file :avatar,
        :path => ":rails_root/public/system/:attachment/:id/:style/:filename",
