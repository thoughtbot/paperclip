Paperclip is now compatible with aws-sdk >= 2.0.0.

If you are using S3 storage, aws-sdk >= 2.0.0 requires you to make a few small changes:
* You must set the s3_region.

* If you are explicitly setting permissions anywhere, such as in an initializer,
note that the format of the permissions changed from using an underscore to using a hyphen.
For example, `:public_read` needs to be changed to `public-read`.

If you want to continue using an earlier version of aws-sdk, replace
 aws-sdk with aws-sdk-v1 in your Gemfile.

If both are in your Gemfile, paperclip will use aws-sdk v2.
